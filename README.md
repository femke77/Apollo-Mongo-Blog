## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

A quick and simple blogging application built in TypeScript, React, and Apollo GQL with 1 level of comments. The focus here was not on CSS, so it's minimal. The app uses JWT authentication and Outlet context provided by react router dom to check loggedIn status when needed. An auth guard component protects the profile route. 

Currently using refetch functionality for updating the DOM but intend to switch to the Apollo cache.

## Known Issues

- Need pagination implementation
- Client code is not as componentized as it should be i.e. no Comment or CommentList
